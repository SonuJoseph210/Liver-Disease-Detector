# Liver-Disease-Detector

Liver disorder diagnosis system using machine learning techniques aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of liver disorder diagnosis.
This system consists of several modules, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, algorithm selection, and model training and evaluation.

# Algorithm: Decision Tree
In "Liver disorder diagnosis using machine learning technique",
Decision Tree is used as a machine learning algorithm to diagnose liver disorders based on various input features such as age, gender, total bilirubin level, direct bilirubin level, and albumin level.

The dataset used in this study consists of patient records with and without liver disorders and their corresponding input features. The Decision Tree algorithm is trained on this dataset by constructing a tree-like model that recursively splits the data based on the values of the input features.

The algorithm selects the best feature to split the data based on criteria such as information gain or Gini impurity, which measure the purity of the resulting subgroups. The trained Decision Tree model can then be used to predict the presence or absence of liver disorders for new input data.
